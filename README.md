For more information about cellular automatons: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton

3D_plots.py - making 3D plots, of air_density as a function of pressure and temperature;

fluid_densities.py - my package with functions to measure densities of several fluids, 3D_plots.py is using it.


Requirements:
Python 3 interpreter;
Matplotlib library;
Numpy library;
